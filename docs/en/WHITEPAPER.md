# Bitpy Whitepaper

## Abstract

Bitpy is a **fully decentralized cryptocurrency** utilizing **Proof-of-Work (POW)** consensus with **1 quintillion total coins** and a minimum unit of **0.0001 coin**. Designed specifically for **daily transactions, SMEs, and international commerce**.

Bitpy operates **without central servers** - anyone can participate as a miner, store balances, and receive rewards. The system supports **QR code transactions**, **free micro-transactions**, and implements a **tiered fee structure** based on **30-day cumulative transaction volume** per address.

**Privacy Features:** Balances and total coins sent remain private.  
**Public Transparency:** Transaction parties, remaining supply, total fees, and fee distribution are publicly visible.  
**Primary Goal:** Sustainable price appreciation, security from liquidation, and cross-border usability.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The current cryptocurrency landscape lacks solutions that effectively serve daily micro-transactions while maintaining decentralization and privacy. Bitpy addresses this gap through innovative economic and technical design.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- High transaction fees for small payments
- Centralized control in many "decentralized" systems
- Lack of privacy in transparent ledgers
- Volatility and manipulation concerns

## 2. Vision & Mission

### 2.1 Vision
To create a cryptocurrency that achieves mass adoption for everyday transactions while maintaining true decentralization and sustainable economic incentives.

### 2.2 Mission
1. Enable free micro-transactions for daily use
2. Implement anti-manipulation mechanisms
3. Provide balanced privacy and transparency
4. Support international fractional payments
5. Maintain full decentralization

## 3. Economic Model

### 3.1 Tokenomics
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quintillion)
- **Minimum Unit:** 0.0001 coin
- **Block Reward:** Adaptive based on network activity

### 3.2 Fee Distribution
- 70% to Miners (POW)
- 20% to Staking Participants
- 10% to Pending Supply (ecosystem fund)

## 4. Technical Architecture
